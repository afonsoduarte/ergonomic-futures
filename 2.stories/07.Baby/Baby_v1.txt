What is the face, the figure of humanityâ€”life lived on the 50th percentile?  We can't define the deviant without first inventing the "norm."

It's no coincidence that this word came into popular use in the mid-Nineteenth Century, as Adolphe Quetelet generated social statistics, drawn from biological and criminological data, to determine the physical and moral qualities of "the average man."  A preamble to the eugenics movement, this "man" was an empirical fiction who became, at once, more lifelike and less precise with the addition of quantitative information.  He was the first of many disciplinary hallucinations to come, culminating, in the later century, with Francis Galton's composite portraits of the "criminal type."  Layering photographs, Galton claimed, did more than produce averages, providing the equivalent optical information to a large statistical table.  The "real generalizations" of Galton's composites, in other words, revealed faces of true evil as data manifest.

Galton's fixation on criminality betrayed a larger apprehension about Quetelet, for his "average man" made deviants even of the taller, the smarter, and those of superior moral rectitude.  Contemporaneous with his establishment of eugenics, Galton thus reframed Quetelet's work to emphasize the median over the mean: where one stands in the rank, as opposed to who comprises the average.  The "norm" thus became less observed than ideal: an aspiration for social betterment, giving cause to selective breeding.
