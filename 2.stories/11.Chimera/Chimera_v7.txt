What makes a human distinctively so?

That's a "human-racist" question, pure and simple.  If political equality isn't synonymous with physical equality, then why shouldn't it encompass any "persons" possessing feelings and consciousness?  Why can't the posthuman, the uplifted animal, and the intelligent machine share full status as citizens?  Already we find them in our midst, from the corporations acting as legal persons, to the cyborgs built of disabled humans and assistive technology.  Already human skin cells have fused with rabbit ova: the animal poised to climb the chain, the human to transcend it.  When will their rights be granted?
