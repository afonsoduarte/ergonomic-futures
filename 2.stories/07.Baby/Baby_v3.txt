Composite photography went the way of most 19th Century pseudosciences, fading into forgetfulness like the ears, the hair, the facial quirks of its constituent subjects.  Nowadays, digital technology allows for a more elaborate hunt on the picture-plane—pixel by painstaking pixel, layer upon infinite layer—but our true measure no longer lies on the surface of the image, but deep in the grain of the self.

In the sequencing of the human genome, we've at last moved beyond the "rough draft" of humanity, producing a "standard reference work"—a "'consensus' DNA sequence" that, David Serlin notes, is, "like all composites, a fiction."  After all, how can we define the normalcy of a constantly changing genome?

The genomic norm, by purporting genetic explanations for human attributes and behaviors, also implies the possibility of genetic solutions.  To claim to be a corrective, Serlin and other disability theorists argue, it must entrench or create the problems.

What is the figure, the future of humanity—life engineered for the 50th percentile?  If we gradually assimilate to the genomic norm, we will forgo much more than deviance.  As our genetic diversity lessens, vulnerabilities increase: minor viruses will easily grow epidemic large, extinction endgames preying on our lack of divergence.  The many routes of human evolution, for that matter, will only grow on the tree of fiction.
