A few years ago, a group of UFO believers approached Shara, an anthropologist working on dental morphology in hominins and early humans.  They claimed to have found an ancient jaw of tantalizingly unknown provenanceâ€¦

Shara agreed to talk with the television reporter covering the story, stating something to the effect of: "In my professional opinion, this jaw is a fake.  There's nothing on earth that looks like this."

For whatever reason, her first sentence was cut from the broadcast segment.  Shara has been a darling of the believer community ever since.
