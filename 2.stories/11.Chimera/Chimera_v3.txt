What makes a human distinctively so?

Why, that we don't need to rely on biology!  If will, choice, and purpose are our distinguishing traits, as theologian and bioethicist Joseph Fletcher claims, then laboratory reproduction is far more human than the coital variety.  Ever one to follow an argument to its futurological conclusion, Ray Kurzweil predicts that "traditional reproduction may begin to seem antiquated, if not downright irresponsible."

By attempting to end our dependency on heterosexual reproduction, transhumanists have attracted some unexpected allies.  The ghost of Shulamith Firestone, for instance, will likely not enjoy rubbing shoulders with the techno-patriarchal set, but there's no denying her insistence, in _The Dialectic of Sex_, that a woman cannot be free with freeing herself from incubation.  Randy Wicker seems less troubled by the affiliation, embracing cloning as a means of rendering "heterosexuality's historic monopoly on reproduction obsolete."  The stalwart gay rights activist may be the best thing to happen to the cloning cause.
