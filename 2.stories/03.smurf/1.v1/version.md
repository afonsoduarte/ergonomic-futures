There was a time when you couldn't find the Smurf village without being led by a Smurf, and even then, the journey was considerable.  Mountains, deserts, marshes, and forests encircle "the Cursed Land" they call home.

Isolation, it seems, yields utopian results.  Absent are the instruments of economy, the myths of individuality keeping us forever at arm's length.  Everyone has a strength performed to communal effect; none lacks a bed in a mushroom.

The Smurfs should be happy, and yet they're blue.  A smile tells one story, and the skin another.  Does the seclusion, the inbreeding make them so?  The strain of a magical thought stretched to the scale of society?  Or the recognition that, capitalists or not, they're the essential ingredient for turning matter into gold?

Nowadays, you can visit without needing a guide.  "The Cursed Land" is a bit of Kentucky around Hazard and Troublesome Creek Times.  These Smurfs pale in comparison to their televisual peers.  They've been blue since 1820 and are fading every day: whenever a stranger dilutes the stock, whenever a new highway presents itself.  Perhaps, on a bluer planet, they'd have better successâ€¦

The story of the Fugates is disappointingly scientific.  Their tint owes to a blood disorder, which produces a surplus of hemoglobin unable to release oxygen into the body.  Yet their propagation merits a literary gloss, for how rarely does the world plot two humans in relative seclusion, who both happen to carry the fateful recessive gene?

This tree grows sideways and byways, not onwards and upwards.  "You'll notice," said one descendent, that "I'm kin to myself."
