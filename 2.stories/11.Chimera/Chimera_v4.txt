What makes a human distinctively so?

There are more things on earth than were dreamt of in Greek mythology.  The chimeras of lore—all lion, goat and snake—pale in comparison to creatures like Karen Keegan and Lydia Fairchild: previsions of Wicker's dream that, man or woman, gay or straight, we will all gain the right to be our own twin.

Of course, Keegan and Fairchild didn't have much say in the matter.  The chance fusion of eggs gave these women forty-six chromosomes apiece, effectively making them multiple people.  It's conceivable that each could have lived and died in relative ignorance of this fact, if not for the legal strictures that bind us, each and every one, to a single DNA signature.

In the early 2000s, Fairchild's application for public assistance required her children to take DNA tests, revealing a mismatch between their genetic makeup and her own.  Fairchild's assertion of her maternity meant little to the state, which suspected welfare fraud.  Another test, given to a baby Fairchild _had just birthed_, produced the same results.  At this point, there was no room for doubt: Fairchild was, in fact, both the genetic mother and aunt of her children.

The exceptionalism of this case, as Aaron T. Norton and Ozzie Zehner write, actually illuminates the norm: biogenetics has become the dominant model for determining and defining kinship.  Personal testimony pales against genetic evidence, which creates "technological confessions for these mothers through a privileged objectification of their biological attributes."  Moreover, this biologically determined understanding of kinship beleaguers more than DNA oddities; as Taylor Flynn reports, transgender parents, who are genetically related to their children, have on occasion found their parental rights nullified for failing to match their biological sex.

Whatever can be judged by the cover of a book, its insides are always more truthful.
