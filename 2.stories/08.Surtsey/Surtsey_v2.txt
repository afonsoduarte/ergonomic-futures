In 1963, the state of nature leapt off the page and into the sea.  More swan dive than swan song, as the cook of a nearby fishing trawler reported, the old bird proved to have some life in her yet.  Centuries of philosophical blowhard had kept her aloft, and her descent was just as exaggerated, with a ripple, a splash, some thunderous applause, the darkening of the sky and the darkening of the soul, wars begun under mistaken pretenses, wars concluded on similar grounds—and a volcanic divan, emerging from the murky depths to provide a resting place for the diva.

That was just the first week.  For the next four years, the divan grew to island size, an upside-down comma of unspoilt perfection, which nearby Iceland delegated a nature reserve.  Hobbes, Locke and Rousseau must have rolled in their graves at the missed opportunity, for the scientists tasked to monitor the island did little more than watch which way the wind blew, limply waiting for a seed, a _something_ to happen.

It turns out that the state of nature, in practice, isn't much of a read.  Gradually, grasses, plants and ferns made their way from the mainland, but the evolutionary magic of islands—the mammoth becoming the mouse, the dwarf the giant—has not enchanted the land of Surtsey yet.  Human intruders, thankfully, have forced her hand: trace tomatoes, in a loitering bowel movement, eventually sprouted a plant; some naughty boys were caught planting potatoes.  For the right price, a crooked fisherman will even ferry you, under the cover of moonlight, to indulge in a clandestine shit.

If this island is any indication, then contrary to what the philosophers claimed, society was not a coping mechanism for the savagery of the wild, but a novelty, a distraction from the state of total boredom.
