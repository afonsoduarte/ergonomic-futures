"Quaddie" is a racist term awaiting political correction, but how else to describe four-armed workers engineered for free fall environments?

The Quaddies are the legal property of a mining company.  As "post-fetal experimental tissue cultures," they're too many rungs down Aristotle's ladder to share human rights and protections.

A Quaddie body is bottom-heavy, the lower arms bowed and muscled.  It's what you get when you put a chimpanzee on a horse, then remove the horse.
