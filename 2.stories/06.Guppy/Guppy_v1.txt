We are getting stupider.

In the last 20,000 years, our brain has lost roughly the size of a tennis ball, diminishing the most valuable, untapped resource on the planet.  And while the resulting organ leaves some gray matter to mine, gone are countless cognitive potentials for the making of a superior future human.

The problem is domestication.  As Harvard primatologist Richard Wrangham has shown, each of our domesticated animals possesses ten-to-fifteen percent less brain volume, compared to their wild counterparts.  Selection against aggression, he suspects, favors individuals with juvenile brains.

Human domestication has yielded similar results, though it goes by another name.  "The social contract" constricts our savagery, building laws to fence us in.  Those few barbarians born in captivity—those "more complete people," writes Nietzsche (by which he means "more complete beasts")—are made the exceptions to prove this rule.  A breeder decides which dog will live on through its litter, and capital punishment, which human will die.
