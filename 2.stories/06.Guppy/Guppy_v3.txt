We are getting smarter.

A big brain was the Mark 1 of cognitive processors, scaled to fit its Cro-Magnon case.  For all the energy guzzling, it had little to show: the massive muscles of the hominid continued to motor, backwards from predators and forwards to prey.  Surviving the state of nature required this basic amount of tact; society is no less treacherous, but with security enough for the brain and the body to begin to relax.

The true measure of the brain is its complexity on cellular and molecular levels.  Neural density correlates to computational capacity.  True, our processors are growing larger again with the benefit of good nutrition, yet demand too much energy and the body will suffer, blackouts rolling across the biological grid.  When researchers selected for larger-brained guppies, for example, gut sizes shrunk as much as twenty percentâ€”and reproduction rates by the same amount.  No wonder the top-heavy humans of fictional futures are often infirm from head to toe.
