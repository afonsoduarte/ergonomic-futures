What is the shape, the size of democracy?  It's bigger than a breadbox and smaller than a planet, too much for the individual and rarely enough to fit a nation, like a mismatched lid on a boiling pot that lets the steam escape.

For the 1939 World's Fair, the industrial designer Henry Dreyfuss scaled democracy as a model city, purpose-built with good intentions.  There, each and every citizen would enjoy a garden apartment, a bucolic view, the landscaped highway to his job in the city, the landscaped highway for a swift retreat.  "Democracity" claimed to depict the world one hundred years hence, but for many visitors, it was just around the corner.
