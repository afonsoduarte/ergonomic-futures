Sometime in the next two thousand million years, our brain will be fully mapped, its quirks and capacities painstakingly known.  The entire history of human enterprise has worked towards this era: when the organ can be employed to full effect, its neurons fired at maximum strength.  Our descendants ready an approach to the truly profound, yet to their surprise, hit an evolutionary brick wall.

Insights come in the strangest places.  Thrown back on their rumps and looking groggily about, they notice the objects in orbit—the twinkling stars, the cuckoo birds, the brains flying out of their noggins.  Perhaps the most they can do, in light of their limits, is to build this next link in the chain.

In prototypical form, this next human is an exaggeration, even by homuncular standards.  Embryonic manipulation yields a brain twelve feet in diameter, vaguely attached to a diminutive body.  Whatever the intellectual gains of growing so large a brain, there are equal losses in autonomy.  This prototype will live an unhappy four years, at the mercy of bioregulation machines, until obesity does it in.

Eventually, our descendants perfect their design, the organ growing to span a forty-diameter turret, built with pockets in which its gyri collect.  Lords of these concrete towers, Übermenschen manifest, the "Great Brains" are even more demanding than their prototype, requiring such a wealth of material resources as to turn their makers into voluntary slaves, destined to toil away for these idols.

With infinite intellectual ability, the "Great Brains" could venture far beyond the confines of human thought, exploring wilds beyond our imagining: the true savagery of the mind.  Yet the further they travel, the more they recognize that their astounding cognitive gifts come at severe bodily cost.  Could their capacities, they wonder, create a more perfect being, mind and body in greater harmony?  The next link in the history of human enterprise, it seems, merely repeats the first.
