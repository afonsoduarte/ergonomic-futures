_The Great Chain_ is a multi-part project, which asks questions about contemporary "fitness" through the lens of speculative evolution.  Specifically, this work comes out of research into the field, as well as interviews with paleoanthropologists, ergonomists, evolutionary biologists, and genetic engineers.  To each I have asked: What are future scenarios for imagining new types of human bodies, and how might this thought experiment cast relief on conversations about body normativity in the present day?  Together, we have discussed everything from founder's effect to space colonization and genetic engineering, all of which may contribute to marked differences in how we define the "human."

Practically, this project takes two forms.  First, working with New York industrial designers Bureau V, I've designed functional, ergonomic seats for future bodies.  The initial presentations of these seats are in the 11th Gwangju Biennale and _making the unknown one's ally_, opening at Fondation d'enterprise Galeries Lafayette in October 2016.  Following these exhibitions, the seats will have long-term use in fine art and natural history museums in Seoul and Paris.
